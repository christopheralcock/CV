## Christopher Alcock

I solve problems. Having graduated from Makers Academy in October 2015, I’m looking for a junior developer role at a company that values TDD and strong staff development.

## Skills

#### Problem solving

I’m very good at taking large problems, breaking them down into smaller problems and concisely communicating them to others.

My actual job experience isn't exciting, hence this career change, but from it I've become adept at getting along with people in an office environment and general soft professional skills. In my personal life I take a lead on organising things and getting people to the right places at the right times and I’m good at keeping track of stuff.  I’ve played in bands and organised gigs and tours and accommodation and transport.

#### Communication

I’ve an English degree and used to write music reviews for various websites before the ubiquity of music streaming made descriptive and opinionated writing on music itself fairly redundant.  I retain an ability to sum things up effectively yet thoroughly.

My medium profile from my time at Makers (https://medium.com/@christopheralcock) demonstrates this fairly well.

#### Malleability

With my lack of longterm experience in coding comes a malleability and eagerness to learn new things, giving any company that hires me the opportunity to shape me in the image of their ideal developer.  I know exactly how one would use rails to get a site up and working but have no interest in using it for the sake of it or out of habitual comfort.
