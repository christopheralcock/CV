## Christopher Alcock

I solve problems. As a recent graduate of Makers Academy, a 100-hour-per-week, three month long development bootcamp, I’m looking for a junior developer role at a company that values TDD and strong staff development.

## Skills

#### Problem solving

I’m very good at taking large problems, breaking them down into smaller problems and concisely communicating them to others.  My [final project at Makers](https://github.com/christopheralcock/live-voting) is a great example of this - I storyboarded the UX which we then used to outside-in BDD the project, coordinating with Waffle cards.

My longterm job background is in Higher Education administation and data processing, and from it I've become adept at getting along with people in an office environment, organisation and planning.  I currently liaise between departments in order to make sure over a thousand incoming Exchange Students are registered on the right modules and their records kept accurate for academic and visa-related reasons.

In my personal life I take a lead on organising things and getting people to the right places at the right times - every year I get 30+ friends together for Christmas dinner, and they generally consider it the highlight of their years.  I've also booked tours and sorted out accommodation and transport for bands I've played in.

#### Communication

I have an English degree and used to write music reviews for various websites.  This has given me the ability to sum things up efficiently, yet thoroughly.

My [Medium profile from my time at Makers](https://medium.com/@christopheralcock) demonstrates this fairly well.

I also worked at [Last.fm](http://last.fm) in a customer service role, communicating problems between development teams and users, who were generally without technical backgrounds.

#### Commitment

In taking three months unpaid leave from job and paying for the Makers Academy course, I've demonstrated huge commitment to trying to become the best developer I can.  I'm very excited to get the chance to start afresh in a career in which there's no limit to the things you can learn, the people you can learn from and the problems you can solve.  Since the course, along with trying to solidify what I've learnt, I've been attending meetups and hackathons, exposing myself to new concepts and meeting new people, as well as winning [prizes](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ev-hackathon-you-say-whats-all-richard-fish).


#### Focus & Determination
