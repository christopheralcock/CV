## Christopher Alcock

Software Engineer at UK Parliamentary Digital Service (PDS), focussing on data, particularly in the context of Graph Databases. 
I'm looking to further hone my software engineering skills.

## Skills

#### Data Modelling

My main focus whilst working for PDS has been on the development and maintenance of our Graph Database [Ontology](https://github.com/christopheralcock/Ontology).  As well as contributing to the [theoretical modelling work of the Parliamentary domain](https://github.com/christopheralcock/Ontologies) I have lead on applying these models in the database.

#### Communication

In my time in the PDS Data & Search team I have been the main point of contact for the team building the new Parliamentary website, communicating our progress and offering support with our Data Platform's APIs.

I have an English degree and used to write music reviews for various websites.  This has given me the ability to sum things up efficiently, yet thoroughly.

My [Medium profile from my time at Makers](https://medium.com/@christopheralcock) demonstrates this fairly well.

I also worked at [Last.fm](http://last.fm) in a customer service role, communicating problems between development teams and users, who were generally without technical backgrounds.
